### 👋  my TypeScript Exercises! 💻

This little corner of the digital world showcases my journey into the wonderful world of TypeScript! 
🌱 Here, you'll find the exercises I've been practicing, demonstrating my understanding of key TypeScript concepts and tools. Let's take a quick peek at what's inside! 👇

## 🛠️ Getting Started (The Toolkit!)

This section shows how I set up my development environment to work with TypeScript. It's like gathering all the right tools before starting a big project!

### 📦 Node.js and npm (The Package Handlers)

First things first, I made sure I had Node.js and its trusty sidekick, npm (Node Package Manager), installed. These help manage all the cool libraries and tools we need!

### 🌐 TypeScript (Globally & Locally - Like Having a Translator Everywhere and Just Here!)

Globally: This makes the tsc (TypeScript compiler) command available in any project on my computer.
Locally (within this project): This keeps the TypeScript version specific to this exercise directory.

### 📂 Git (My Project Time Machine!)

I also initialized Git to keep track of my changes, like having a rewind button for my code!

Initialized locally

### 💡 VS Code (My Awesome Code Editor)
For writing and managing my code, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It's super helpful with TypeScript!

**Recommended Extensions:**

**Prettier:** Makes my code look beautiful and consistent. ✨

**ESLint:** Helps me catch potential errors and follow code style guidelines. 🧐

**TypeScript (built-in):** Provides excellent TypeScript support right out of the box! 📦

### ⚙️ Running the Code (Making Things Happen!)
Here's how I made my TypeScript code run:

Compiling with ```tsc:` I used the TypeScript compiler to turn my .```ts` files into JavaScript (.js) files that the computer can understand.

Running with Node.js: Once compiled to JavaScript, I used Node.js to execute the code.

### 📄 tsconfig.json (My TypeScript Project Settings)


This file in my project directory tells the TypeScript compiler how to do its job. Here's a basic example of what it might contain:


### 🧠 TypeScript Fundamentals (What I've Learned!)

This is where the fun begins! Here's a glimpse of the TypeScript concepts I've practiced in these exercises:

### 🚀 What's Next?
This is just the beginning of my TypeScript journey! I'm excited to continue exploring more advanced concepts and build even cooler things. Stay tuned! 😉

Thank you for taking a look! 🙏
